# topseed4j
Helper library for Java. Over the few projects we work on, these are some things we often need - so we share this in our projects - so it is easier at runtime.

Likely you don't want to be here other than to view the dependencies/BOM in lib folder.

Use in gradle like this:

			dependencies {
				compile "com.github.appthings:topseed4j:v1.xx.XX"
			}
			// where xx.XX is the latest version.
